A pixel is a point on an image that represents a specific color, opacity, or shade. It can be represented in one of the following ways:

Before we start working with image processing, it's important to understand what exactly an image is. In terms of its dimensions, an image is represented by its width and height. For instance, if an image's dimensions are 500 x 400, then its total number of pixels is 200000.

The introduction of the multi-core technology known as MOS in the 1970s has revolutionized the way electronic signal processing is done. This led to the development of various electronic devices such as single-chip computers and digital signal processors. Today, digital image processing is widely used in various applications.

The discrete cosine transform (DCT) image compression algorithm has been widely implemented in DSP chips, with many companies developing DSP chips based on DCT technology. DCTs are widely used for encoding, decoding, video coding, audio coding, multiplexing, control signals, signaling, analog-to-digital conversion, formatting luminance and color differences, and color formats such as YUV444 and YUV411. DCTs are also used for encoding operations such as motion estimation, motion compensation, inter-frame prediction, quantization, perceptual weighting, entropy encoding, variable encoding, and motion vectors, and decoding operations such as the inverse operation between different color formats (YIQ, YUV and RGB) for display purposes. DCTs are also commonly used for high-definition television (HDTV) encoder/decoder chips.

In 1972, the engineer from British company EMI Housfield invented the X-ray computed tomography device for head diagnosis, which is what is usually called CT (computer tomography). The CT nucleus method is based on the projection of the human head section and is processed by computer to reconstruct the cross-sectional image, which is called image reconstruction. In 1975, EMI successfully developed a CT device for the whole body, which obtained a clear tomographic image of various parts of the human body. In 1979, this diagnostic technique won the Nobel Prize.
